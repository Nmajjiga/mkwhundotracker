Tracker for All Unlockables in Mario Kart Wii and Additional Items such as a blue shell tracker, lightning tracker, POW tracker, and Shell/Falls tracker

To install the tracker, just install the releases section and install java 10 and beyond and run the JAR file in the program. It should pop up the application which you can easily modify and customize for your own benefit. The tracker does not have instructions on how to unlock each character/vehicle specifically but merely serves as a display mechanism for those doing 100% Speedruns. If you want information on how to unlock each character in the game, continue reading the readme file and the instructions will be below.

Hotkey information:
Increase Bike Count - Q
Increase Kart Count - W
Increase Character Count - E
Increase Blue Count - R
Increase Lightning Count - T
Increase POW Count - Y
Increase Misc (Shells, Thunder Clouds, Other Players) Count - U
Increase Fall Count - I

All Unlockables are displayed in this image below and the instructions needed to unlock each one of them. Feel free to download this if you need but there is an infographic in the software that allows you to do it easily:
